        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>


        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <p>

            If people understand how thier brain works and what actually happens when something is learnt
             it can make people more motivated to learn and to practice a task they may have thought they 
             couldn’t do before, or maybe thought they weren’t intelligent enough. 

        </p>
        <h2>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
        <p>
            By practicing something I have learnt repetitively
             but also going back and reminding myself of things I have learnt, so that any connections made do not fade. 

        </p>

        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>

            Practice, relating new information to something already known.

        <h1>Research Growth Mindset</h1>
        
        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
        <p>
            The idea that intelligence is not a “set” and that one can become smarter, the brain is not stuck. 
            It is relevant because when an individual knows this, they may be more likely to achieve knowing that their brain
             can change and they are not “smart” or “dumb”
        </p>
        
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        <p>
            I wasn’t really surprised as I already knew about how things were learned, but it did 
            make me think about genetics and how if someone is raised a certain way or from intelligent parents, surely 
            the children from the more intelligent family who raised them on intellectual conversations would no doubt 
            produce a child that found learning easier because they already have more connections available to build information on. 
        </p>
       
       <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
            I will incorporate it into my learning, by reminding myself that when I cannot do something 
            it is not because I am not smart but just that I need to work harder and practice more and I can then improve. 
            Think about different ways to learn
