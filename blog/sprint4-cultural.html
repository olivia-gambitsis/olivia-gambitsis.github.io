        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <h2>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people</h2>
        <p>
            If people understand how their brain works and the idea that the brain can adapt and change, it can be 
            more motivating to learn new things, change unhealthy behavoirs, and encourage people to try things they 
            may have thought they weren't "smart" enough or capable enough to do before.
        </p>
        <h2>Discuss how might engage with the principals of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</h2>
        <p>
            I believe I can benefit from understanding the idea that practicing something over and over again or revising something causes 
            stronger connections between the neurons in your brain. This is good motivation to keep my brain active and to keep going over and
            practing concepts that I have learnt. 
        </p>
        <h2>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity</h2>
        <p>
            Practice and revision are important. Our brain is also better at remembering something if we can associate it with something we already know!
            This is because we already have strong connnections in the brain for things that we have learnt before. If we can 
            relate the new information to that, then not as many new connections need to be made.

        <h1>Growth Mindset</h1>
        <h2>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</h2>
        <p>
            Growth Mindset is the idea that intelligence is not a “set” value and that one can improve, the brain is not stuck. 
            It is relevant because when an individual knows this, they may be more likely to achieve knowing that their brain
             can change and they are not “smart” or “dumb”. One of the most important things in developing a growth mindset
             is embracing challenges. Just because you cannot do something straight away does not mean that you will never be able to do it, it just 
             means that you may need to work a bit harder or change your approach. Another important part of developing a growth mindset is to stop comparing 
             yourself to others, everybody is at different stages and they may have different upbringings and education. It is better to compare your current self to your 
             past self, for example; has your ability to do a certain thing improved compared to how it once was??. 
        </p>
        <h2>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h2>
        <p>
            I did already have an idea about how things are learnt, through neuron connections and the importance of practice and 
            revision. I have been finding this course challenging and I think reading about the growth mindset has definitely inspired me to work on 
            developing this mindset myself.  
        </p>
        <h2>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h2>
        <p>
            I will incorporate it into my learning, by reminding myself that when I cannot do something 
            it is not because I am not smart but just that I need to work harder and practice more and I can then improve. 
            I think as I mentioned above its important that when I find something difficult I need to see it as a challenge, 
            not as a barrier.
