      <h2>What are the differences between relative, absolute, and fixed positioning?</h2>

      <div class="relative">
        <h2>Relative postioning</h2>
        <p>Firstly here are some boxes I made in HTML which I will use to show how the different position values in CSS affect
           elements on a webpage. 
          <div class="no-position"><img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="no-position-boxes"></div>

        </p>
      <p>
        Relative postioning is where an element (e.g. text or an image) is positioned relative to where its defult postion is (or where it would normally
        be postioned). If you changed the positioning with top, right, bottom, left, the element 
        will move away from this defult position. When the element is moved, the position of other elements on the page
        are not affected. Take a look at what happens to the yellow box when I use position:relative and move it 5px from the left
        and 5px from the top. 
        <div class="relative02"><img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="no-position"></div>
        It moves the yellow box 5px from the top and 5px from the left from where it was originally, and the other boxes (elements) are not affected. 
        They just stay in the same spot as if the yellow box never moved. 


      </p>
      </div>

      <div class="absolute">
        <h2>Absolute positioning</h2>
        <p>
          When an element has a position value of "absolute" it is no longer part of the document flow, if it is moved
          there will be no space left where the element was. The layout of other elements will act as if the 
          element was not there and take up the leftover space. You can use top, right, bottom and left to position
          the element. This will move the element relative to the box that it is in. If it is not in a parent box, then 
          this will just move the element relative to the body of the page. Let's take a look at an example of this. Here
          I moved the yellow box 5px from the top and 5px from the left, but this time using position:absolute;
          <div class="absolute02"><img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="no-position"></div>
          As mentioned above the box moves 5px from the top and 5px from the left but rather than from the position it was
          originally in, it moves relative to the whole page!.  This is because the box in not inside another specified element, so it
          will just move relative to the HTML document itself. You can also see that the box has been removed from the flow
          of the document! as if it doesnt exist the other boxes move to fill the space it once occupied. 
          Say, for example the smaller boxes where inside a bigger box and that was set to 
          position:relative and the yellow box position:absolute, then if I moved the yellow box, it would move relative to the larger box. 
          Here I have made a big white box to show this concept. 
          <div class="absolute03"><img src="img_girl.jpg" alt="no-position"></div>

          You can see that the yellow box moved 5px from the top and 5px from the left but relative to the big white box, not 
          the whole page!. 

        </p>
      </div>

      <div class="flixed">
        <h2>Fixed positioning</h2>
        <p>
          When an element on a webpage has a position value of "fixed", it means that position that
          element is in is indeed "fixed". The element will not move from that position, even if the user
          scrolls. It will alway stay in the same position on the screen. This position is often used for a 
          button that would take you back to the top of the page. The button moves with you as you scroll so you
          can click on it to take you back to the top.
