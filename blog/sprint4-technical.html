    <h2>A time where I got blocked on a simple problem</h2>
    <p>
        Back in sprint-3 I had a block on a really simple problem in the DOM interactions challenge. I felt super frustrated because it seemed 
        like an easy challenge and I couldn't understand where I was going wrong. The instructions said to use getElementsByClassName which would 
        return an array and then I would need to find the length of the array. Then assign that to the totals. I couldn't understand why
        I needed to use length and which class to use. My game counters kept coming up with NaN or undefined. I then decided to have a look 
        at the elements on the browser and saw that a color class came up when the dots changed color which I added in the previous challenge. 
        I was definitely making it a lot harder than it needed to be and the answer was quite simple. I just needed stop and think about what I was
        wanting the code to achieve rather than just trying things and seeing what happens. I think if i'd used pseudocode here it would have been 
        helpful.

    <h2>A time where I solved a problem in an elegant way</h2>
    <p>
        I don't think I have solved a problem in an "elegant" way yet!. However, I did have a bit of trouble passing one of 
        the tests in the superfizzbuzz challenge. I had already spent so much time trying to understand what to do and I thought I had it, then
        everytime I ran the code the following error came back.

    </div>
    <p>
        I could not see where I had gone wrong and I got really frustrated. I ended up writing down in a list what I wanted the code to
        do. I then realised I had added the new array to the original array rather than making it equal to it. I think writing down what I wanted 
        the code to do definitely helped!.

        <h2>Reflect on how confident you feel using the problem solving techniques and process:</h2>
        
        <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
        <p>
            I am still not 100% confident in writing Pseudocode, but my understanding is that it is an explaination of what you will write
            the code to do. Sometimes I feel like i'd rather just start writing the code. 
        </p>
        <h3>Trying something</h3>
        <p>
            I use this method too much, rather than thinking something through fully, I will just do it and see what happens. I think the 
            long run this can be a waste of time and I don't think this method is the best, to use all the time!. 
        </p>
        <h3>Rubber ducky method</h3>
        <p>
            I am confident in using this method. At one point in sprint-3 I got really stuck on a question and reached out to someone in the cohort
            and as I was describing what I didn't undertsand I suddenly understood it. If I had just used the rubber ducky method and described 
            my problem to an inanimate object first I may not have had to annoy someone else. 
        </p>
        <h3>Reading error messages</h3>
        <p>
            I am confident with this technique, sometimes I don't understand what the error message means but most of the time I can copy and paste 
            it into google and someone has explained it before. 
        </p>
        <h3>Console.logging</h3>
        <p>
            I am confident with console.logging. 
        </p>
        <h3>Googling</h3>
        <p>
            This is probably the technique I use most. I find that someone on stackoverflow has nearly always asked the same question before.  
        </p>
        <h3>Asking your peers for help, Asking coaches for help</h3>
        <p>
            I am getting better at asking others for help, I always try everything on my own first because I hate bothering other people. 
        </p>
        <h3>Improving your process with reflection</h3>
        <p>
            Relfecting is becomming more and more useful, to prevent myself making the same mistakes twice!. 
        </p>
