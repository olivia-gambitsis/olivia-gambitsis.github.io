<h2>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h2>

<p>
EQ stands for Emotional Quotient, but is more commonly called emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence describes 
the capability that a person has to be fully aware of their own emotional states. It is being able to stop and evaluate 
(even if only for a second) how you are feeling, why you are feeling that way and how to manage the emotions that you may be feeling.
 If somebody has a good understanding of their own emotions then it is likely they will be better at understanding those of other people.
  A big part of emotional intelligence is being self-aware and being able to recognise the way your emotions impact on others and vice versa. 
  Part of being emotionally intelligent is the ability to show empathy, by understanding how others may be feeling or thinking. Empathy fuels connnection, by being empathetic 
  you can feel “with” somebody, not “for” them. Daniel Goleman (who wrote the 1995 bestseller Emotional Intelligence) said that one of the domains of emotional intelliegence 
  is the ability to manage ones emotions. For example making sure that negative emotions don’t get in the way of what you are doing or take over. 
  This also applies to positive emotions, if you can understand what makes you feel good, then you can align aspects of your life with these emotions. This 
  shows that EQ is not only important for social skills and realationships but also ones own ability to concentrate, manage time and perform better. </p>


<h2>How is it different to IQ?</h2>

<p>
IQ (Intelligence Quotient) measures another kind of intelligence,  aspects of a persons IQ can include 
their ability to apply logic, learn, understand, solve problems and retain information.
Merriam-Webster defines IQ as “a number used to express the apparent
 relative intelligence of a person, or ones proficiency or knowledge in a specific subject.  
 IQ and EQ are very different, in that an IQ test does not meaure ones ablity to express or control emotions. </p>



<h2>Why is it important?</h2>

<p>
Almost all aspects of life involve interacting with other people. If a person 
has a very low EQ then it is going to make life a lot more difficult epsecially 
when working with others no matter how high their IQ is. I you have the ability 
to control and understand your emotions then not only will it be easier to work
 with yourself but also others. People will always prefer to work with or 
 listen to somebody that they like rather than somebody they don’t. This doesn’t mean 
 that having a high EQ will make people like you but if you have a good understanding 
 of your own emotions and in turn how your actions can make others feel, then there is a 
 good chance you will be easier to work with and communicate with.
