        <h1>My Learning Plan</h1>

    <h2>My Long Term Goal/s</h2>
   <p>
    My long term goal is to one day have the skills to apply for jobs that would allow me to work as a programmer overseas or in jobs where I have
    the ability to work remotely. After a few years working as a Pharmacist I decided I wanted to travel and work overseas. However, my degree 
    was only recognised in New Zealand and I couldn't practice anywhere else without studying again in said country. I would also like to potentially 
    one day combine my pharmacy knowledge and programming knowledge to improve access to healthcare.

    <h2>Skills I would like to develop (non-technical - human skills) while at EDA?</h2>
    <p>
    I would like develop better communication skills and patience. I have a tendency to be really impatient if I am explaining things or 
    when I am in a stressful situation. This is definitely a limitation I have when it comes to working in a team. 
    </p>


    

    <h2>How I will manage my workload during this programme</h2>
    <p>
    Coming from working full time, I have come into this programme with the mindset that it is a full time job. I was working six days a week 
    before starting this programme. I believe the best way for me to manage the workload is to continue with same schedule as I 
    did when I was working 8 hours a day. During foundations I intend to study full time Monday to Friday 9:30am to 6:00pm, any time I loose during 
    the day I will make up at night. I intend to only study a few hours on the weekend. 
    When it comes to bootcamp, 70 hours per week is recommended. This is a lot of time to spend studying. 
    I think the best way for me to manage this is to have a plan at the start of each week, including meals, chores, sleep, exercise and fun. 
    </p>
<h2>
    Seeking help
</h2>
   <p>
       When it comes to seeking help, I think I will always try my best to find the answer on my own first, then reach out to my cohort, 
       and then the facilitators. I would like to be able to come to the facilitators for help if I cannot find the asnwers elsewhere. I also look
       to the facilitators for constuctive critism on my work.
