        <h1>Sprint-5 Cultural Blog</h1>
        <h1>Reflections</h1>

        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            I learnt more about culture, what my culture and values are and how they are influenced. I learnt 
            that I don’t have a growth mindset, I always thought I was too old or not wired the right way to learn certain things, but alot of it
             just comes from me being worried about what other people may think if I fail.
        </p>

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
            Empathy is useful because it is about being understanding and being aware of the experiences of other people, in a way 
            seeing something from somebody elses view. This is 
            important in software development because not only do programmers often work in teams but also because it is about creating something 
            that other people will eventually use. Having a good level of self awareness is important for time management, managing stress and also 
            working with others!. If you know yourself better, when you are most focused, what triggers your emotions and your biggest causes 
            of stress then you can manage your emotions more effectively and in turn work more efficiently.  


        </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            What has surprised me the most is how it is relevent to programming. In saying that I think that the core learning would
            be useful for any work environment. I was also surprised in the listening and looping challenge. I discovered I don't listen 
            fully. I find my mind thinking about what is being said and how I can reply to it rather than just listening and absorping the 
            information. 

        </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the the most challenging aspects was probably staying focused on the tasks. When I was researching I tended to veer off topic a bit.
            I also found some of the questions quite challening to answer, especially the questions in the sprint-1 cultural blog.
            These were the most challenging for me because these were things I had given 
            the least thought to prior to the course. Trying to understand my culture and values was difficult because I 
            really didn’t know what my culture was. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending 
            so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think the reason is because nowadays it is key that people can work in teams, so being able to
            communicate effectively, understand and respect others and understand yourself are all important for 
            being able to co-operate in a team. It is also important to be able to have these skills so you can work effectively 
            yourself which will in turn make you more employable.  

        </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
            Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            It did sometimes, I felt like I didn’t really need to be doing it. However I think that the growth mindset and 
            neuroplasticity section was actually really helpful especially when I was struggling trying to gasp some of the 
            concepts in JavaScript. Learning the Core material also was a nice break from the technical side of things sometimes. 
            If I was having trouble with some of the technical course work, i’d do some of the core learning tasks and go back to 
            the technical challenges later. Although it was frustrating sometimes, I do think it is an important aspect.

        <h1>Learning Plan</h1>
        

        <h2>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h2>
        <p>
            I would like to gain the skills to work as a freelance web developer and have skills 
            that would make me employable not only in NZ but around the world. In the future I would like to grow my skills
            in other languages and work on developing applications and software for use in healthcare. 

        </p>

        <h2>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h2>
        <p>

            I think that my strengths of being curious and keen to learn will be helpful. I think self-doubt is 
            a big one for me. There was quite a few times during foundations that I just felt really stupid and felt asthough maybe
             this is just not something that I could get good at.  I think it may be hard to keep that negative voice in my head quiet
              in Bootcamp because it will be really challenging. 
        </p>

        <h2>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h2>
        <p>
            I think my biggest challenge will be staying focused. I have studied before and am confident that I can do it again,
             but it is definietly going to be a big change from working 40 hours a week and then doing whatever I like after work
              and on the weekends to having to commit to a lot more hours of work. 
        </p>

        <h2>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h2>
        <p>
            As i mentioned in my learning plan I would like to improve at being more patient and develop better communication skills while working in a team. 
            When I was learning about pair programming it seemed like something I wouldn’t want to do because I really don’t like it when i’m being watched when trying to do things, I get 
            nervous and suddenly can’t spell or type! I think that pair programming seems like a method that would be really useful in some situtations. Therefore this is something I would like some 
            practice at, so I may not find it so daunting.
        </p>

        <h2>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h2>
        <p>
             According to the dev academy website during bootcamp working 70 hours per week is recommended. This is a lot of time to spend studying. 
            I think the best way for me to manage this is to have a plan at the start of each week, including meals, chores, sleep, exercise and fun. 
            I think if I spend as much time as possible studying on weekdays then I can set out some time on the weekend to do other things. I will go to 
            my other people in my cohort or my facilitator if I cannot do something on my own first, or need feedback.
