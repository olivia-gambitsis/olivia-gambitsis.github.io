        <h2>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            I learnt more about culture, what my culture and values are and how they are influenced. I learnt 
            that I don’t have a growth mindset, I always thought I was too old or not wired the right way to learn certain things, but alot of it
             just comes from me being worried about what other people may think if I fail.
        </p>

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
        <p>
            Empathy is useful because it is about being understanding and being aware of the experiences of other people, in a way 
            seeing something from somebody elses view. This is 
            important in software development because not only do programmers often work in teams but also because it is about creating something 
            that other people will eventually use. Having a good level of self awareness is important for time management, managing stress and also 
            working with others!. If you know yourself better, when you are most focused, what triggers your emotions and your biggest causes 
            of stress then you can manage your emotions more effectively and in turn work more efficiently.  


        </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            What has surprised me the most is how it is relevent to programming. In saying that I think that the core learning would
            be useful for any work environment. I was also surprised in the listening and looping challenge. I discovered I don't listen 
            fully. I find my mind thinking about what is being said and how I can reply to it rather than just listening and absorping the 
            information. 

        </p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
        <p>
            One of the the most challenging aspects was probably staying focused on the tasks. When I was researching I tended to veer off topic a bit.
            I also found some of the questions quite challening to answer, especially the questions in the sprint-1 cultural blog.
            These were the most challenging for me because these were things I had given 
            the least thought to prior to the course. Trying to understand my culture and values was difficult because I 
            really didn’t know what my culture was. 
        </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending 
            so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</h2>
        <p>
            I think the reason is because nowadays it is key that people can work in teams, so being able to
            communicate effectively, understand and respect others and understand yourself are all important for 
            being able to co-operate in a team. It is also important to be able to have these skills so you can work effectively 
            yourself which will in turn make you more employable.  

        </p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? 
            Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>
        <p>
            It did sometimes, I felt like I didn’t really need to be doing it. However I think that the growth mindset and 
            neuroplasticity section was actually really helpful especially when I was struggling trying to gasp some of the 
            concepts in JavaScript. Learning the Core material also was a nice break from the technical side of things sometimes. 
            If I was having trouble with some of the technical course work, i’d do some of the core learning tasks and go back to 
            the technical challenges later. Although it was frustrating sometimes, I do think it is an important aspect.
