<h1>Sprint-1 Cultural Blog</h1>

<h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>

<h2>Core personal values</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Family</li>
    <li>Kindness</li>
    <li>Knowledge</li>
    <li>Happiness</li>
    <li>Adventure</li>
</ul>

<h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
<p>
I think culture has been the most difficult concept to understand when it comes to my own culture. 
I always thought culture was only related to your ethnic group or religion. I was not raised in a religous environment and am 
not religous myself and although my Dad is Greek, I do not identify with Greek culture. I find it hard 
to define New Zealand culture because we are a young country made up of so many different nationalities. However, through a bit of research I found that 
your culture can be influenced by a huge range of things other than ancestry and religion, such as education, profession and family. I am very
close with my family and I consider family as one of my core values. A lot of my cultural identity is influenced by my family. For example, how I should treat
others and the importance of working hard. In terms of education and profession, I think being a pharmacist also has influenced by values and identity. As a healthcare professional
it is your duty to help others and make sure your range of knowledge in the feild is always up to date. In healthcare not only is academic knowleges important but having
having an understanding of other cultures is important too. Happiness is something I value because I know if I am happy I am more motivated to live 
by my other values. Lastly I think being adventurous and experiencing new things can make you happy! 
 </p>

 <h3>
 Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss 
 how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h3>
<p>
    hmmmmmm. 
</p>

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Curious: I always want to know more about things, how they work. </li>
    
   <li>Adventurous: I am always keen to try new things!</li>

    <li>Diligent</li>
</ul>
    
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
   <li>Overthinker: I often overthink, I often look for underlying meanings in things. This quote about my personality type from Meyers Briggs explains it perfectly 
    “It’s not uncommon for Campaigners to lose a bit of sleep asking themselves why someone did what they did, what it might mean, and what to do about it”. 
    This ties in with being really sensitive. I think because I value kindness I have trouble understanding when people are unkind. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Easily distracted: I think I can be easily distracted, I have trouble focusing on one thing at a time, often I will suddenly think of something 
    I want to do and have to do it then and there.</li>
    
    <li>Self-critical: This is a limitation I found after talking to my family. I think find it hard to not compare my successes and failures 
        to those of other people.</li>
        </ul>


<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
<p>
I have a drive to learn and am curious about the world and new things which makes learning something new or developing my career something that is really exciting to me. 
I always want to know more and be able to have different skills and a broad knowledge base. However this can make it hard for me to focus on one thing, for example 
I would be in the middle of an assignment and ill read a news article about a congressman in the states and will go on a tangent into what a congressman is and what they do and the United States 
political system and before I know it Ive spend all this time learning something but not really what I need to be doing at that point in time. I think this is something I need to work on, the time box method 
 and using toggl while completing the work in sprint one has helped a lot, it brings me back to the task at hand. I terms of career development it can also make it hard for me to decide
what I want to do, because there is so many things id like to do. Although I love to learn new things, if I don’t understand something straight away I easily get frustrated and stressed. 
</p>

<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>

<p>Already I am excited to begin. Always being curious and keen to learn will definitely help in this journey. When things get hard, I just need to remember it 
is all learning and I do not have to get everything straight away. Being diligent will also help on my journey. </p>

<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.
There has been many times where I have worked with other people on projects at university and in the workplace.</h3>

hmmmmmmm.
