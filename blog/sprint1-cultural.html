<h1>Sprint-1 Cultural Blog</h1>

<h1>Identity, Values and Strengths Exploration</h1>

<h2>Core personal values</h2>

<ul class="core-values">
    <li>Family</li>
    <li>Kindness</li>
    <li>Knowledge</li>
    <li>Happiness</li>
    <li>Adventure</li>
</ul>


<h2>How my culture has influenced my values and identity</h2>
<p>
I think culture has been the most difficult concept to understand when it comes to my own culture. 
I always thought culture was only related to your ethnic group or religion. I was not raised in a religous environment and am 
not religous myself and although my Dad is Greek, I do not identify with Greek culture. I find it hard 
to define New Zealand culture because we are a young country made up of so many different nationalities. However, through a bit of research I found that 
your culture can be influenced by a huge range of things other than ancestry and religion, such as education, profession and family. I am very
close with my family and I consider family as one of my core values. A lot of my cultural identity is influenced by my family. For example, how I should treat
others and the importance of working hard. In terms of education and profession, I think being a pharmacist also has influenced by values and identity. As a healthcare professional
it is your duty to help others and make sure your range of knowledge in the feild is always up to date. In healthcare not only is academic knowleges important but having
having an understanding of other cultures is important too. Happiness is something I value because I know if I am happy I am more motivated to live 
by my other values. Lastly I think being adventurous and experiencing new things can make you happy! 
 </p>

 <h3>
 Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss 
 how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took</h3>
<p>
   In some of the Pharmacies I have worked in, I have had owners or managers put pressure on me to sell certain products in the Pharmacy. 
   For example, natural health products such a vitamins and supplements. I have been told that as a Pharmacist I have the ability to sell
   products because people will listen to my advice and often buy the product I recommend. This poses a problem, because a lot of natural health products 
   and vitamins have no evidence. Natural health products are not classified as "medicines" therefore they don't undergo the same clinical trials 
   medicines do and therefore often don't have a lot of evidence that they do anything at all. For example, a lot of people believe that vitamin C 
   is good for boosting the immune system and preventing coughs and colds. There has actually been a quite a few trials on vitamin C and there is not solid evidence for this. 
   There are products in Pharmacies that retail for up to $60 for "superior absorption vitamin C" which is a lot of money for some people to spend if something probably won't make any difference.
I think it is important to be honest. If I am asked if something works for a said condition, I think it is my duty to tell the person asking that there is no evidence and if I know it probably won't work I should tell them. 
   This is has caused a few dilemmas for me especially when it is expected of me by an employer to sell products.

<h2>Strengths and limitations</h2>

    <h3>Strengths</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Curious: I always want to know more about things, how they work. </li>
    
   <li>Adventurous: I am always keen to try new things!</li>

    <li>Diligent</li>
</ul>
    
    <h3>Limitations</h3>
    <ul>
   <li>Overthinker: I often overthink, I often look for underlying meanings in things. This quote about my personality type from Meyers Briggs explains it perfectly 
    “It’s not uncommon for Campaigners to lose a bit of sleep asking themselves why someone did what they did, what it might mean, and what to do about it”. 
    This ties in with being really sensitive. I think because I value kindness I have trouble understanding when people are unkind. 
    </li>
    
    <li>Easily distracted: I think I can be easily distracted, I have trouble focusing on one thing at a time, often I will suddenly think of something 
    I want to do and have to do it then and there.</li>
    
    <li>Self-critical: This is a limitation I found after talking to my family. I think find it hard to not compare my successes and failures 
        to those of other people.</li>
        </ul>


<h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
<p>
I have a drive to learn and am curious about the world and new things which makes learning something new or developing my career something that is really exciting to me. 
I always want to know more and be able to have different skills and a broad knowledge base. However this can make it hard for me to focus on one thing, for example 
I would be in the middle of an assignment and ill read a news article about a congressman in the states and will go on a tangent into what a congressman is and what they do and the United States 
political system and before I know it Ive spend all this time learning something but not really what I need to be doing at that point in time. I think this is something I need to work on, the time box method 
 and using toggl while completing the work in sprint one has helped a lot, it brings me back to the task at hand. I terms of career development it can also make it hard for me to decide
what I want to do, because there is so many things id like to do. Although I love to learn new things, if I don’t understand something straight away I easily get frustrated and stressed. 
</p>

<h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles</h3>

<p>Already I am excited to begin. Always being curious and keen to learn will definitely help in this journey. When things get hard, I just need to remember it 
is all learning and I do not have to get everything straight away. Being diligent will also help on my journey. </p>

<h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>

<p>
    During my last year of University I had an elective group project which took the entire year. We all had very differnt study habbits and 
    ideas about how to complete the work. I wanted to just do as much as possible at the beginning and get it out of the way whereas some of the group
    didn't mind leaving things to the last minute. We decided to divide the work load into specific sections, so we could work at our own pace and 
    then collaborate our work at the end. This was a good method, however there was a lot of arguement over who did what and that some sections were 
    harder to do than others. It's hard to decide who does what, because what one person would class as a lot of work someone else might think is not much
    work at all!. I think now if I was to do this project again, I would suggest that if one person finishes before someone else, they could potentially help
    anyone that is struggling to complete their workload.
